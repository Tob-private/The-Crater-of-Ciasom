> A long time ago, during a forgotten age of history, kings and queens, knights and wizards ruled the world. Beyond the castle walls, beyond the villages and farms, the world was wild and dangerous. Vicious goblins dwelled deep in the dark forests. Dragons soared amongst the towering mountain peaks. Demons hid in the dark cracks in reality. Mad necromancers raised armies of skeletons from ancient graveyards. And terrible, oozing horrors slithered through the ruins of ancient kingdoms 
> 
> That world is your world now. You are a fledgling adventurer. You have left your life behind to brave the wilds, to explore the dark forests and climb mountain peaks, to plunder the ancient ruins of forgotten empires.
